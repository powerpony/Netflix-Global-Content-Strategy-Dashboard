### 1. Content Growth Over Time (2008–2019)  
The number of Netflix titles increased significantly between 2008 and 2019 (from 2 to 2016 number of titles). 
This surge aligns with Netflix’s aggressive global expansion and investment in content acquisition during this period.

### 2. Post-2019 Decline  
After 2019, the number of new titles added dropped notably (from 2016 to 1498 number of titles in 2021).

- **“International”** genres dominate, showing Netflix’s intent to diversify its catalog for regional audiences.

### 5. PG-Rated Titles Still Hold Value  
**PG-rated** content forms the third-largest rating group and also been part of the top five genres, suggesting Netflix should continue to invest in family-friendly or children's content.
This ensures the platform caters to every age from households and younger viewers alongside its older audience.
